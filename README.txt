Hello Mo,

Attached is the file for QAP 4.

I decided ultimately to define the reports as functions and call on them in the main.py program for ease of use.

I ran into an issue with importing separate .py files where you could not run an imported file twice without exiting and
restarting the program. I found some solutions online but they fell outside the scope of the project so I figured why
not just do it the way we were taught!

Thanks,
Glen
